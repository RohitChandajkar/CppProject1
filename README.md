Geometric Console Application
The objective of this project is to display area and perimeter of 2D geometric shapes such as Rectangle, Triangle, Circle and Ellipse. The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.
Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:
include: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.
src: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
main.cpp: Main source file where the program execution starts.
1. Rectangle
Header: include/Rectangle.h
Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp
2. Triangle
Header: include/Triangle.h
Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp
3. Circle
Header: include/Circle.h
Implementation: src/Circle.cpp
