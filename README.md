# Geometric Console Application

## Overview
The objective of this project is to create a console application that computes and displays the area and perimeter of various 2D geometric shapes such as Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, and Ellipse. The project is structured with a modular approach, utilizing separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class representing a geometric shape.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **include:** Contains header files for each geometric shape class.
- **src:** Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
- **main.cpp:** Main source file where the program execution starts.

## Classes and Files
### Rectangle
- **Header:** include/Rectangle.h
- **Implementation:** src/Rectangle.cpp

### Triangle
- **Header:** include/Triangle.h
- **Implementation:** src/Triangle.cpp

### Circle
- **Header:** include/Circle.h
- **Implementation:** src/Circle.cpp

## Building and Running
To build and run the application:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have a compatible C++ compiler installed.
3. Compile the source files including main.cpp and all the respective implementation files.
4. Execute the compiled executable to run the Geometric Console Application.

## Usage
Once the application is running, it should prompt the user for input regarding the geometric shape they want to compute the area and perimeter for. Users can interact with the application through the console interface, providing necessary parameters like dimensions or radius depending on the shape.
